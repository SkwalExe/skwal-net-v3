        <h1>👨‍💻 Léopold Koprivnik</h1>
        <p>I am 15 years old and have been passionate about computer science for many years. I started by learning web development, but quickly became interested in other areas such as cybersecurity, low-level programming, and system/network administration. I have set up my own server rack in my room, with two XCP-NG virtualization servers on which I host my personal website, my emails, a private VPN, and many other things.</p>

        <h1>🤔 What is Skwal.net</h1>
        <p>Skwal.net is my personal website, where I share my projects, my thoughts, and my knowledge. I also host a few services, such as my emails, my blog, a NextCloud instance, and more. I also use this website as a playground to experiment with new technologies and to learn new things.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I created skwal.net in 2018 when I was 10 years old, and have since been actively maintaining it. When I wrote the first line of code for this site, I knew nothing about computer science. I gained a lot of experience and skills while developing this website; it represents my first experience with programming. I've made several versions of this site over time, each time using new technologies (JavaScript frameworks, CSS libraries, web servers...).</p>
